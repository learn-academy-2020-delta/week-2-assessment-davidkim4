# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. Why would you use the method `super()`?

  Your answer: super() is used for a new constructor to call on a different class and gain access to that classes constructors.

  Researched answer: Calls the constructor from the parent class and gives us access to the parent classes properties and methods



2. What is the DOM? What is the virtual DOM?

  Your answer: Not sure what it stands for, but I think it basically represents an object on an html page as well as its javascript and css. 

  Researched answer: Stands for Document Object Model. It is an interface that allows functions to dynamically change anything on a document/webpage.



3. What is a higher-order function?

  Your answer: It's different from a built in function, higher-order functions can be attached to an object or another method and follows a set syntax inside its parenthesis that will return the outcome with your own twist.  

  Researched answer: They take functions that take other functions as arguments. They can also return functions as return values, or both.



4. What is JSX?

  Your answer: A combination of javascript and html so that you don't need 2 separate files.

  Researched answer: Stands for JavaScript Extensible Markup Language. It allows and makes it easier to add and write HTML in React.


5. What is React? 

  Your answer: A javascript library that allows users to add dynamic components inside a javascript file while combining javascript and html together.

  Researched answer: A JavaScript library for building UI. Let's you create dynamic components on a document.



6. What is yarn? What file(s) are updated when you run `$ yarn`?

  Your answer: yarn allows us to run a .js file like a webpage. As we change anything inside that file, the yarn page also updates our changes immediately. yarn adds a .yarn file and a .json file to your directory. 

  Researched answer: A faster, more secure, and more reliable, new package manager that replaces the workflow for the npm client or other package managers while remaining compatible with the npm registry.



7. What is localhost:3000? How do we use localhost:3000 in the development process?

  Your answer: Not too sure, but the way it's worded makes me thing it has something to do with a server you own? I would have to google it to fully understand what it means and what the 3000 stands for.

  Researched answer: A network address that directs you to your own machine. Works in tandem with node to run your code on your computer.



8. What is an iterable in JavaScript? What data types are iterables? How can this information useful to you as a developer?

  Your answer: Iterables refer to a piece of code that loops through multiple times and executes a function. I believe integers and characters are iterable. This information can be useful as a developer because it can continue a process multiple times autonomously without copying and pasting the same code that many times.

  Researched answer: Iterables are data structures allowing other data gathering methods to access and repeat through it. It's a powerful property for objects that's easy to use and help us avoid writing long path names.



9. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: Holding up code so that its high up there on the file?

  Researched answer: Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.



10. STRETCH: What are closures in JavaScript?

  Your answer: Closures end a javascript function so that you know the scope of a function.

  Researched answer: A closure allows you to access a scope beyond that of a closed function such as its parent scope, even after the parent function is closed.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.
- React state: describes constructs in a .js file that are susceptible to change, meaning they are dynamic components on a web page.
- React props: props is the argument that is being passed down through each constructor in a .js file.
- React lifecycle methods: mounting, updating, and unmounting, all of which can monitor and manipulate a react component
- API: Application Programming Interface, is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other like Facebook messenger.
- e.preventDefault(): a method that cancels an event if it is cancelable.
- DOM events: Allow JavaScript to register different event handlers on elements in an HTML document.
